### Analyzes Every MLB Team From Every Season, 1871 to 2018, and Computes  
1. List the top 50 teams performances, Top 10 overperforming/underperforming teams (actually won/lost more games than expected)
2. Computes all team stats for all Home and Away games to deduce if a Home Field Advanatge had a role in their win/Loss Performances
3. Implements Pandas and NumPy For Data Cleaning, Aggregation, and Analysis

# [Project 2: Bitcoin Trading-Pattern Machine Learning Analysis](https://github.com/YussofKazmi/BitCoinTradingPatternsTestRepository)

### Uses Machine Learning Classification Algorithms To Flag Bitcoin Trading Patterns 
1. Implemented 5 Machine Learning Classification Algorithms and Pandas to analyze and classify Bitcoin Trading Patterns of 30 Bitcoin Trading Entities
2. Models are developed, fed, and tuned with 3 million instances of trading data
3. Concludes Support Vector Machine is the most efficient classification algorithm for trading-pattern detection with a 0.98 accuracy score

# [Project 3: Bioinformatics Gene Motif Calculator](https://github.com/YussofKazmi/BitCoinTradingPatternsTestRepository)

### Uses Machine Learning Classification Algorithms To Flag Bitcoin Trading Patterns 
1. Implements Stochastic Modeling and Monte Carlo Simulations to compute probabilities of gene motif (Gene Code Pattern) appearance over multiple genetic code
2. Concludes if a gene motif is worth investigating by prevalence over randomly generated samples of genetic code (Bioinformatics Enrichment)
3. Utilizes Matplotlib Framework for Graph Visualization of Gene Motif Appearance Probability, Frequency
