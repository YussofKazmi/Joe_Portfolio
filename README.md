# Joe Kazmi's Project Portfolio Website 
##### Hello! Here, are some of my favorite projects I have done, generally Data Science-based ones, but there are others using different technologies

# [MLB Deviations Analysis](https://github.com/YussofKazmi/MLB-Deviations-Project)

##### This Project works in three phases, and analyzes every MLB Team from every season, 1871 to 2018 
Implements Pandas and NumPy For Data Cleaning, Aggregation, and Analysis
##### 1.) List the top 50 teams performances - measured by how many games the team outperformed (more wins) their expected win loss in the given year.
##### 2.) Calculate the average deviation (in games) between actual performance and expected performance across all years for each team
##### 3.) Lists top 10 overperforming teams (actually won more games than expected) and top 10 underperforming teams (actually won less games than expected).
##### 4.) Lists all teams, and their win stats, and deviations form expected performances during Home and Away games to deduce if a Home Field Advnatge had a role in their win/Loss Performances
